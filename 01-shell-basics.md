# The Unix Shell

## Background

At a high level, computers do four things:

- Run programs,
- Store data,
- Communicate with each other, and
- Interact with us.

They can do the last of these in many different ways, including direct brain-computer interfaces and speech recognition, using systems such as Alexa or Google Home.
While such hardware interfaces are becoming more commonplace, most interaction is still done using screens, mice, touchpads and keyboards.
Although most modern desktop operating systems communicate with their human users by means of windows, icons and pointers, these software technologies didnâ€™t become widespread until the 1980s.
Before this time, most people used *line printers.*
These devices only allowed input and output of the letters, numbers, and punctuation found on a standard keyboard, so programming languages and software interfaces had to be designed around that constraint.

**Let's introduce two terms.**
Command line interface(CLI) and graphical user interface (GUI)
- *command-line interface,* or CLI is an interface that developed from keyboard inputs
>The heart of a CLI is a *read-evaluate-print loop,* or REPL: when the user types a command and then presses the Enter (or Return) key, the computer reads it, executes it, and prints its output in the shell window.
The user then types another command, and so on until the user logs off.
The shell is a **command-line interface** which is useful for complex, purpose-specific things.
It uses a simple vocabulary of commands that are typed in by the user.
- *graphical user interface,* or GUI, which has windows, icons and pointers.
They are easy to learn and fantastic for simple tasks where "click" translates into "do the thing I want". It relies on wanting a simple set of things, and having programs that can do those things.

### The Shell
The Shell is a program which runs other programs rather than doing calculations itself.
The most popular Unix shell is Bash, (the Bourne Again SHell ---  
it's derived from a shell written by Stephen Bourne).
Bash is the default shell on most modern implementations of Unix
and in most packages that provide Unix-like tools for Windows.

### Is CLI difficult to use?

It's a different model of interacting than a GUI, and that
will take some effort to learn. A GUI presents you with choices and you select one. With a **command line interface** (CLI) the choices are combinations
of commands and parameters, more like words in a language than buttons on a screen. They aren't presented to you so you must learn a few, like learning some vocabulary in a new language. But a small
number of commands gets you a long way, and we'll cover those essential few today.

### Activity
- Where are some places you'll encounter a command line interface?
Using the etherpad, take a minute to enter answers for these:
- Advantages/disadvantages of CLI
  - advantages are its high action-to-keystroke ratio, its support for automating repetitive tasks, and its capacity to access networked machines
  - disadvantages are its primarily textual nature and how cryptic its commands and operation can be
- Advantages/disadvantages of GUI


### Flexibility and automation

The grammar of a shell allows you to combine existing tools into powerful
pipelines and handle large volumes of data automatically. Sequences of
commands can be written into a *script*, improving the reproducibility of
workflows and allowing you to repeat them easily.

In addition, the command line is often the easiest way to interact with remote machines and supercomputers.
Familiarity with the shell is near essential to run a variety of specialized tools and resources
including high-performance computing systems.


### What does it look like?

Let's take a look at the shell window looks like:

~~~
SHOW MY SHELL WINDOW
~~~

The first line shows what's called a **prompt**, indicating that the shell is waiting for input.
- Your shell will have different text for your prompt; it includes information about who and where
you are.
- The prompt ends with a dollar sign ($)
- When you type commands, you *don't type the prompt*, only the commands that follow it.

# Files
You need to download some files to follow this lesson:
- open your shell (also called terminal and command line)
  - on Mac, go to Applications - Utilities - terminal
  - on Windows, you should have Git for Windows downloaded
    - go to Start menu, find Git Bash, and open

## What to type
- go to etherpad
- copy
> git clone https://github.com/mleverance/uark-swc-files.git
- now type 
> cd Desktop
> git clone https://github.com/mleverance/uark-swc-files.git
