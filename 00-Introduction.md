# Introduction
Good morning!

**Who am I:**

Mary Leverance
* Role at U of A: Preservation coordinator for Libraries & CAST
* Master's of information and library science, and Bachelor of Science in geography
* Prior to university, worked with GIS and data
* Decided to become an instructor after attending a couple SC trainings over the past couple years
* Saw how learning the basics can get you started on the path of more advanced work
* Personal benefits of shell: renaming many files, processes in digital preservation use command line
* My learning is on-going; for me, learning the basics took some dedicated time and practice, just like anything new, but I can now build on those principles

# Teaching methods
- Interactive
  - We want you to learn by doing, so you'll code along with us
  - Won't be hours of lecture
  - You'll get to test your understanding with exercises
- Collaborative note-taking on the etherpad
  - Have it open in a browser because we'll be pasting information for you there
  - https://pad.carpentries.org/2019-03-18-uark
  - Everyone welcome to add notes or questions
  - Workshop geared towards people who are beginners and new to these topics
  - If you're already familiar with a concept, welcome to help out by adding notes to the etherpad or help your peers
- Further practice and additional learning resources
  - All lessons will be available online after the workshop via link in etherpad

# Getting help
- Sticky notes
  - Used like flags for either getting help in real time from helpers or letting us know you're good
    - Blue: we're cool
    - Yellow: think of it like a caution or slow down signal, "please assist"
  - Put sticky on side of your computer for now, we'll do periodic sticky checks
- Peer learning
  - Are you familiar with these concepts? Feel free to act as an impromptu helper 
  - Sometimes you'll work with the person next to you

# Ice Breaker
- Let's take a couple minutes to get to know each other
- Share your name and college/department
- Three words about yourself - can be discipline related, hobby, favorite food, tv - anything that you feel describes you
- My three words: preservation - puns - tea
