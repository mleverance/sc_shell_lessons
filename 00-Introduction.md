# Introduction
Good morning!

**Who am I:**

Mary Leverance
* Role at U of A: Preservation coordinator for Libraries & CAST
  - Oversee preservation of physical materials in the libraries, and work with digital materials with CAST
* Master's of information and library science, and Bachelor of Science in geography
* Prior to university, worked with GIS and data
* Decided to become an instructor after attending a couple SC trainings over the past couple years
* Saw how learning the basics can get you started with more advanced work
* My personal benefits of shell: renaming many files at once, processes in digital preservation use command line
* My learning is on-going; learning the basics took dedicated time and practice, just like anything new, but I can now build on those principles

## Teaching methods
- Interactive
  - We want you to learn by doing, so you'll code along with us
  - Won't be hours of lecture
  - You'll get to test your understanding with exercises
- Peer learning
  - Workshops geared towards absolute beginners and no background on these topics
  - Maybe you're familiar with some concepts? Feel free to act as an impromptu helper to your neighbor
  - Sometimes you'll work with the person next to you
  - So, we'll take a minute to meet the people around you
  - Find someone around you who you don't know, and introduce yourself - your name, department, why you're here, and for fun, your favorite snack

## Getting help
- With interactive learning, there might be times when you need help, or we might want to check the room to see if everyone is ready to move on
- You'll see a blue & yellow sticky note at your seat
- The sticky notes will be signals for the instructors and helpers
  - Use them like flags at the top of your laptop (demonstrate)
    - Blue: I'm cool, ready to proceed
    - Yellow: think of it like a caution or slow down signal, "helper, please assist"
  - We'll do periodic sticky checks so if we say something like "blue stickies up when you finish the exercise", please participate

## Collaboration
- Collaborative note-taking using the etherpad
  - Everyone welcome to add notes or questions
    - If you're already familiar with a concept, welcome to help out by adding notes to the etherpad or help your peers
 - What's an etherpad? (Open browser) 
  - On the notes section of the workshop website; open it in a new tab from there
  - You can also type the url in your browser: https://pad.carpentries.org/2019-03-18-uark
- Etherpad functions
  - Left side for notes
  - Right side for chat, enter text at bottom
  - Will live on at this url
    - Can export the pad using the arrows button
  - Everyone (including helpers) enter your name
    - This will associate your name with the color in the box
  - Find the section for yourself and add your name, department, Twitter handle if you have one 
  
## Do you want to practice what you learn?
- All lessons we go over will be linked in the etherpad after the workshop
- There isn't time to cover everything in the lessons, so you can benefit by going back to them
