# Introduction
Good morning!

**Who am I:**

Mary Leverance
* Role at U of A: Preservation coordinator for Libraries & CAST
  - Oversee preservation of physical materials in the libraries, and work with digital materials with CAST
* Master's of information and library science, and Bachelor of Science in geography
* Prior to university, worked with GIS and data
* Decided to become an instructor after attending a couple SC trainings over the past couple years
* Saw how learning the basics can get you started on the path of more advanced work
* Personal benefits of shell: renaming many files, processes in digital preservation use command line
* My learning is on-going; for me, learning the basics took some dedicated time and practice, just like anything new, but I can now build on those principles

## Teaching methods
- Interactive
  - We want you to learn by doing, so you'll code along with us
  - Won't be hours of lecture
  - You'll get to test your understanding with exercises
- Peer learning
  - Workshops geared towards absolute beginners and no background on these topics
  - Maybe you're familiar with some concepts? Feel free to act as an impromptu helper to your neighbor
  - Sometimes we'll have exercises that will require you to work with the person next to you
  - We'll take a couple minutes to meet the people around you
  - 30 seconds: turn to your right and make introductions - your name, department, why you're here, and your favorite snack
  - 30 seconds: turn to your left and do the same
  - If you're on the corner find another person who isn't talking to someone

## Getting help
- With interactive learning, you might need help, or we might want to check the room to see if everyone is good
- Instead of raising your hand for help, you'll see a blue & yellow sticky note at your seat
- The sticky notes will be signals for the instructors and helpers
  - Used like flags at the top of your laptop
    - Blue: I'm cool, ready to proceed
    - Yellow: think of it like a caution or slow down signal, "helper, please assist"
  - We'll do periodic sticky checks where we ask for feedback

## Collaboration
- Collaborative note-taking on the etherpad
  - Everyone welcome to add notes or questions
    - If you're already familiar with a concept, welcome to help out by adding notes to the etherpad or help your peers
 - Open it in a browser 
  - https://pad.carpentries.org/2019-03-18-uark
  - If you're having trouble, put your yellow sticky flag up
- Etherpad functions
  - Left side for notes
  - Right side for chat, enter text at bottom
  - Will live on at this url
    - Can export the pad using the arrows button
  - Enter your name
  - Add your name, department, Twitter handle in the appropriate section

## Do you want to practice what you learn?
- All lessons we go over will be linked in the etherpad after the workshop
- There isn't time to cover everything in the lessons, so you can benefit by going back to them
