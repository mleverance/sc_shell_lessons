# Introduction
Good morning!

**Who am I:**

Mary Leverance
* Role at U of A: Preservation coordinator for Libraries & CAST
* Master's of information and library science, and Bachelor in geography
* Prior to university, worked with GIS and data
* Decided to become an instructor after attending a couple SC trainings in the past year
* Saw how learning the basics can get you started on the path of more advanced work
* Personal benefits of shell: renaming many files, processes in digital preservation use command line
* My learning is on-going
